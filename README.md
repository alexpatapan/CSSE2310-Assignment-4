This program was developed as part of a Computer Systems course I undertook at the University of Queensland.

Multiple instances of this program can connect together to form a TCP/IP network of warehouse nodes in a supply chain process. The program utilises multi-threading concepts allowing for a realistic implementation used for a business scenario.
